\end{figure}

\section{Temperature readout}
Run the script in \texttt{oven\_test\_scripts/temperature\_readout} to print out temperature measurements in real time. Touch the thermocouples on each tube one after the other to check that the temperature reading changes.

\clearpage
\section{Low power testing}
Measure the current, voltage, and temperature characteristics of the oven at a low/safe power. Run the script in \texttt{oven\_test\_scripts/low\_power\_heating} and enter the channel of oven to be tested. Use the plotter script to make the graph, and the output should look like figure \ref{fig:low_power_heating}.
This measurement determines that everything is connected correctly, the restance of the oven and wiring, and the polarity of the thermocouple connection.

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Example data for low\_power\_heating test. NB if the temperature reading decreases throughout the measurement, this indicates that the sensor polarity is inverted}
    \label{fig:low_power_heating}
\end{figure}

To invert the sensor polarity, run the script \texttt{calibration\_settings/reverse\_tc\_polarity.py} on the channel in question. This will save this configuration in firmware.

\section{Duty impulse response}

This measurement allows us to determine the temperature-current (T-C) cross-coupling of the oven.
This effect occurs when oven current flows through the thermocouple wiring in the vicinity of the spot weld.
Figures \ref{fig:duty_impulse_response_low} and \ref{fig:duty_impulse_response_high} show this measurement when there is a low and high T-C coefficient respectively.

\begin{figure}
    \center
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/duty_impulse_response_data_0.pdf} 
    \caption{Example data for "duty impulse response" test where there is a low T-C coefficient.}
    \label{fig:duty_impulse_response_low}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \center
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/duty_impulse_response_data_1.pdf} 
    \caption{Example data for "duty impulse response" test where there is a high T-C coefficient.}
    \label{fig:duty_impulse_response_high}
\end{figure}

Once the coupling coefficient is measured, it can be saved in the flash calibration for the microcontroller with the script \texttt{calibration\_settings/set\_tc\_current\_compensation.py}. To confirm that the compensation works, the duty impulse response script can be run again and the measurement should give a much lower coupling value.

\section{Setup current feedback}

Now the current feedback coefficients need to be set for each channel.
The current feedback controller is a PID controller taking a setpoint in Amps and controlling the duty cycle between 0 and 1.

There are four key parameters for this:
\begin{enumerate}
\item P gain,
\item I gain,
\item D gain,
\item Sample decimation\footnote{Sample decimation is the number of samples to skip before applying feedback. The ADC sampling frequency is \SI{1}{kHz}, so a decimation of 0 will lead to \SI{1}{kHz} update rate, whereas decimation of 4 will lead to one sample every 5 ADC samples giving \SI{200}{Hz}. This is useful when the feedback controller needs to act on long timescales compared with the ADC sampling rate}.
\end{enumerate}
These can be adjusted to optimise the performance of the controller, however I have found the following configuration to work in all cases:
0.008, 0.007, 0, 0.

The script \texttt{setup\_current\_feedback/measure\_current\_feedback\_risetime.py} will test the current feedback on the given channel. The feedback controller parameters are set within the script to the values above. The output of this script will result in a plot like the one shown in figure \ref{fig:current_feedback}, which allows us to verify that the feedback controller is working correctly (i.e. no oscillation, reasonable response time).

\begin{figure}
    \center
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/current_feedback_risetime_data_1.pdf} 
    \caption{Example data for seting up the current controller parameters.}
    \label{fig:current_feedback}
\end{figure}

With the desired current feedback parameters known, program them into the microcontroller with the script in \texttt{calibration\_settings/set\_current\_controller\_settings.py}. This script also asks for the following parameters:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Min/max duty cycle soft limits
\item Maximum setpoint (A)
\item Maximum setpoint slew rate (A/s)
